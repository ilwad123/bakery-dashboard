# ü•ê Bakery Delivery Dashboard

## üìå Introduction

This project delivers a comprehensive Bakery Delivery Dashboard designed to monitor and analyse delivery operations through real-time and predictive analytics. The dashboard features dynamic graphs, summary cards, and various visualisations to display key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, deliveries, and driver activity.

A hybrid CNN-LSTM machine learning model was developed to forecast weekly sales based on historical transaction data, providing actionable insights to optimise operations.Users can also download detailed weekly sales prediction reports as PDFs for easy sharing and offline review.

The implementation involved extensive data cleaning, leveraging Neo4j as a graph database to manage transactions and driver information efficiently, and building a secure, user-friendly full-stack web application using Django. This system enables stakeholders to track performance metrics and forecast sales effectively.

Additionally, the dashboard supports a dark mode interface, enhancing usability for users who prefer a low-light theme.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Translated Korean place names to English  
   - Removed duplicates, nulls, and invalid transactions  
   - Randomised Bristol neighbourhoods and customer coordinates  
   - Normalised and categorised products into: Drinks, Pastry, Desserts, Other Foods  

2. **Driver Assignment Algorithm**  
   - Assigns drivers deliveries within a 15-minute batching window  
   - Enables multiple deliveries per trip using efficient routing with Google Maps API  
   - Calculates real delivery distances and generates performance metrics  

3. **Graph Database (Neo4j)**  
   - Models: `Driver`, `Transaction`, `Product`, `Category`, `Neighbourhood`  
   - Uses Cypher queries to load and connect data without duplication  

4. **Machine Learning Forecast**  
   - CNN extracts features from heatmaps (monthly trends, holidays, etc.)  
   - LSTM learns temporal patterns from historical transactions  
   - Outputs weekly sales forecast (Wednesday to Tuesday)  
   - Scheduled via cron job and integrated into Django backend  

5. **Web Dashboard**  
   - Django backend queries Neo4j and passes JSON to frontend  
   - Chart.js renders real-time graphs on:  
     - Monthly revenue  
     - Category sales  
     - Driver performance  
     - Forecast vs. actual sales  

6. **Authentication**  
   - Django‚Äôs built-in auth system with hashed passwords  
   - SQLite used for login storage  
   - CAPTCHA added for bot protection

## üßæ Datasets

The original datasets (`sales.csv` and `price.csv`) were sourced from Kaggle and then cleaned into modified versions such as `product_modified.csv`, `sales_modified.csv`, etc. Additional datasets like `neighbourhood.csv`, `performance.csv`, and `driver.csv` were manipulated and imported into Neo4j to build the graph database.
